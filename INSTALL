Installing dpic:

   On a Unix-lide system, type `make' to compile the sources, which are
   C99 and gcc-10 compatible and should compile and load on most systems.
   Otherwise type `chmod +x ./configure' (if necessary), `./configure'
   and then `make'.

   With MinGW, in a MinGW shell window, type `./configure' and then `make'
   to add a library to the linking step in order to load the random() routines.

   On older machines you may have to check the settings at the top of
   the Makefile. Type
    `make install' or `sudo make install'
   as necessary, to install the executable in /usr/bin, a man page
   in /usr/share/man/man1,
   and dpic-doc.pdf in /usr/share/dpic.  Typing
    `make PREFIX=local install'
   puts the files in /usr/local instead of /usr.
   To install the executable only, type
    `make installdpic'
   and to install the documents only, type
    `make installdocs'.
   To compile in safe mode, with debug enabled, or with MinGW, DJGPP,
   or other non-Linux compiler, refer to the top of the Makefile.

Web-server installation:

   You probably should disable the sh and copy commands in dpic for
   security reasons.  Uncomment the SAFEMODE definition in Makefile
   or type `make SAFEMODE=-DSAFE_MODE'.  If you do not do this, the -z
   command-line option has the same effect (see below).

Otherwise, commands equivalent to the following should do the trick:
      gcc   -O  -c  main.c
      gcc   -O  -c  -o parser.o dpic.tab.c
      gcc   -O  -c  backend.c
      gcc -o dpic main.o parser.o backend.o -lm

The following has also been used when the random() routines are not found:
      gcc   -O  -c -Dsrandom=srand -Drandom=rand  main.c
      gcc   -O  -c -o parser.o -Dsrandom=srand -Drandom=rand dpic.tab.c
      gcc   -O  -c  backend.c
      gcc -o dpic main.o parser.o backend.o -lm
